# NeuralNetworkFromScratch
A complete neural network from scratch trained on the MNSIT data set. 

After being trained, if given a 28 x 28 image from the MNIST data set it is able
to predict with ~ 85% accuracy what digit is drawn on the image.

The entire neural network is created only using Numpy and Pandas for matrix manipulation
and math. NO tensor flow or machine learning libraries are used, the entire network is 
created from scratch.
